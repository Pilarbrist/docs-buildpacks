## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

This topic describes how to configure and use the Staticfile buildpack.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: <a href="http://bosh.io/docs/trusted-certs.html">BOSH configured custom trusted certificates</a> are not supported by the Staticfile buildpack.</p>

### <a id='definitions'></a>Definitions

**Staticfile app**: An app or content that requires no backend code other than the NGINX webserver, which the buildpack provides.
Examples of staticfile apps are front-end JavaScript apps, static HTML content, and HTML/JavaScript forms.

**Staticfile buildpack**: The buildpack that provides runtime support for staticfile apps and apps with backends hosted elsewhere.
To find which version of NGINX the current Staticfile buildpack uses, see the [Staticfile buildpack release notes](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack/releases).

### <a id='staticfile'></a>Staticfile Detection

If you create a file named `Staticfile` in the root directory of your app, Cloud Foundry automatically
uses the Staticfile buildpack when you push your app.

The `Staticfile` file can be an empty file, or it can contain configuration settings for your app.
For more information,
see [Configuring the Buildpack](#configure) and [Pushing the App](#push_app).

### <a id='memory'></a>Memory Usage

NGINX requires 20&nbsp;MB of RAM to serve static assets.
When using the Staticfile buildpack, we recommend pushing apps with the `-m 64M` option to reduce RAM allocation from the default 1&nbsp;GB allocated to containers by default.

## <a id='configure'></a>Configuring the Buildpack

This section describes configuration options available for the Staticfile buildpack.

To configure these options, add the configuration property as a new line in your `Staticfile`, unless otherwise instructed below. 

<table border='1' class='nice'>
<tr>
  <th>Option</th>
  <th>Description</th>
  <th>Staticfile Configuration</th>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td id="root">Alternative root</td>
  <td>Specifies a root directory other than the default. Use this option to serve <code>index.html</code> and other assets, such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files, from a location other than the root directory. 
  For example, you can specify an alternate folder such as <code>dist/</code> or <code>public/</code>.</td>
 </td>
    <td><code>root: YOUR-DIRECTORY-NAME</code><br><br>
      For example:<br><code>root: public</code></td>

  <td>Displays an HTML page that shows a directory index for your site. A sample of a directory list is shown below.<br>
 <img src="../images/directory-index.png" alt="directory index" style="margin: 20px"><br>
    If your site is missing an <code>index.html</code> file, your app displays a directory list instead of the standard 404 error page.</td>
  <td>
   <code>directory: visible</code>
  </td>
</tr>

<tr>
  <td id="ssi">SSI</td>
  <td>Enables Server Side Includes (SSI), which allow you to embed the contents of one or more files into a web page on a web server.
For general information about SSI, see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Side_Includes">Server Side Includes</a> entry on Wikipedia.</td>

<tr>
  <td id="pushstate">Pushstate routing</td>
  <td>Keeps browser-visible URLs clean for client-side JavaScript apps that serve multiple routes.
    For example, pushstate routing allows a single JavaScript file to route to multiple anchor-tagged URLs
    that look like <code>/some/path1</code> instead of <code>/some#path1</code>.
  </td>
  <td><code>pushstate: enabled</code>

and <a href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gunzip_module.html">gunzip</a> modules, which are enabled by default. 
These modules allow NGINX to serve files stored in compressed GZ format and to uncompress them for clients that do not support compressed content or responses.<br><br>You may want to disable compression under particular circumstances such as serving 
content to very old browser clients.</td>

   <td>Add a new <code>Staticfile.auth</code> to the root or alternative root directory. 
    In the new file, add one or more username and password entries using the following format.

## <a id='push_app'></a> Pushing the App ###

To push your app, you can use either the system Staticfile buildpack or specify a Staticfile buildpack.

### Option 1: Use the System Staticfile Buildpack

To use the Staticfile buildpack installed in your deployment, run the command below in the root directory of the app.
The root directory of the app must contain a file named `Staticfile`.

```
cf push APP-NAME
```
Where <code>APP-NAME</code> is the name you want to give your app.

For example:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf push my-app
Creating app my-app in org sample-org / space sample-space as username<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
...
requested state: started
instances: 1/1
usage: 1G x 1 instances
urls: my-app.example.com
last uploaded: Wed Apr 1 12:55:41 UTC 2020
stack: cflinuxfs2
buildpack: staticfile

     state     since                    cpu    memory        disk         details
#0   running   2020-04-01 12:55:57 PM   0.0%   12.6M of 1G   5.9M of 1G
</pre>

### Option 2: Specify a Staticfile Buildpack

To explicitly specify a Staticfile buildpack, run the command below
in the root directory of the app. You may want to specify a buildpack if your
deployment does not have the Staticfile buildpack installed or the installed
version is outdated.

```
cf push APP-NAME -b BUILDPACK-NAME-OR-PATH
```
Where:

  * `APP-NAME` is the name you want to give your app.
  * `BUILDPACK-NAME-OR-PATH` is either the name of a buildpack that is installed in your deployment or the path to
  a buildpack. You can find the Cloud Foundry Staticfile buildpack in the [Staticfile repository](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack.git)
  on GitHub.

For example:

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf push my-app -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack.git
Creating app my-app in org sample-org / space sample-space as username<span>@</span>example.com...
OK
...
requested state: started
instances: 1/1
usage: 1G x 1 instances
urls: my-app.example.com
last uploaded: Wed Apr 1 12:55:41 UTC 2020
stack: cflinuxfs2
buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack.git

     state     since                    cpu    memory        disk         details
#0   running   2020-04-01 12:55:57 PM   0.0%   12.6M of 1G   5.9M of 1G
</pre>

### Verifying the Push

After you push the app, follow the steps below to verify that the push was successful:

1. Find the URL of your app in the output of the `cf push` command.
For example, the URL in the terminal output above is `my-app.example.com`.

1. In a browser, navigate to the URL to view your app.

## <a id='examples'></a>Example Staticfile Buildpack Apps

For different examples of apps that use the Staticfile buildpack, see the [fixtures](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/staticfile-buildpack/tree/master/fixtures) directory in the Staticfile buildpack GitHub repo.
