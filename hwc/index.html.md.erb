## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

This topic describes how to configure your .NET application for use with the
HWC buildpack and how to push your .NET application to Cloud Foundry.
HWC is a wrapper around [Hosted Web Core API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms693832(v=vs.90).aspx)
for running .NET Applications on Windows.

### <a id='hwc'></a>HWC Setup

HWC relies on `Web.config` configuration for hosting the .NET Applications.

### <a id='push-your-app'></a> Push Your App ###

Follow the steps below to push your application.

<table border='1' class='nice'>
<tr>
<th>Step</th>
<th>Action</th>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td>1.</td>
  <td>Use the <code>cf push APP_NAME</code> command to push your app. Replace <code>APP_NAME</code> with the name you want to give your application. For example:<br>
<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf push my-app
Creating app my-app in org sample-org / space sample-space as username@example.com...
OK
â€¦
requested state: started
instances: 1/1
usage: 1GB x 1 instances
urls: my-app.example.com
</pre>
   If you do not have the buildpack, or the installed version is out-of-date, use the <code>-b</code> option to specify the buildpack as follows:<br>
<code>cf push APP_NAME -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/hwc-buildpack.git</code>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr valign="top">
  <td>2.</td>
  <td>Find the URL of your app in the output from the push command and navigate to it to see your HWC app running.</td>
</tr>
</table>

### <a id='features'></a> Features ###

Below are a set of features that can be used with HWC buildpack

#### <a id='context-path'></a> Context Path Routing

Any HWC hosted application will use the `VCAP_APPLICATION` environment variable
to read out the bound application uris. Any context path that exists in the
application's bound route will be used to properly setup the `applicationHost.config`
to host the application under a non-root context path.

Follow the steps to use Context Path Routing and access `app2` under `app1`'s URL. e.g `app1.example.com/app2`

<pre class='terminal'>
$ cf push app1 #find the URL for your app1
$ cf push app2 --no-start --no-route
$ cf map-route app2 example.com --hostname app1 --path app2
$ cf start app2
</pre>

#### <a id='shadow-copy'></a> Shadow Copy Setting
[Shadow Copy](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228159(v=vs.100).aspx)
is a hosting option that copies assemblies for an application in the `bin` directory
to the application's temporary files directory. This features is turned off and
unnecessary for applications runinng under Cloud Foundry. An app can override this
setting in application's `web.config`.
